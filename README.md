# Project-2D
Project 2D includes performing multiple sequence alignment and pairwise sequence alignment for the p53 sequences of human, chimpanzee, dogs, and elephants. Lastly, a histogram is plotted in order to visualize each species' p53 percent identity with respect to human p53.

Scientific Question: For animals that are known to be less susceptible to cancer, would they have similar p53 protein sequences as human p53 because human p53 is an important tumor suppressor protein that reduces the risk of cancer in humans?

Scientific Hypothesis: If an animal is known to be less susceptible to cancer, then it will contain similar p53 sequence as humans because p53 is an important tumor suppressor protein in humans.

All the fasta files used are included.
